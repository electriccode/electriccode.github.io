Hi I am Pankaj Phartiyal. I am a Frontend developer and I like to solve problems.

I sometimes experiment with <em>UX/UI design</em> and have a good eye for design aesthetics and Web Usability.

I have reasonably good understanding of <em>Programming languages, API design and Databases</em>.

I generally play well in a team as I understand language of a programmer, a designer and non technical people too. I do direct Frontend integrations into existing tech stack and people like me for that (I suppose).

<i>Apart from technology, I like to read Science articles, especially human anatomy. I like to sketch, paint, meditate, hike, cycle and jog. My favorite timepass is doing nothing.</i>
